--Future Developments--
Add feature of POW when survivors are in enemy territory for a set amount of time:
    -Use "UnitRemainInArea"
    -Enemy Units converges onto the downed plane/survivor after a set amount of time





--New Fixes--
Properly rename all Event, Triggers, Scripts and Conditions

Add Notification when a Survivor Marker is found

Add Feature:
    -Ability to disable specific notifications
    -Ability to filter out selected Wreckages
        -Accounts for no Contacts selected
        -Only filter out wreckage

Add a Tip on how to detect survivors:
    -Use Infrared camera at very low range:
        -Equip Helicopters with infrared Helicopter
    -Use a Patrol Mussion to randomly scan the area of possible survivors
    -The Found Survivor will automatically switch to your side
        -This enables them to be put into Helicopters (as cargo) and brough back to any "Land-able" base (Included lone helipads)
    -Gaming Tips:
        -Hold CTRL and hover over units to quickly get info about units/contacts

    
    

SAR Helipoter should have a IR sensors to detect the survivors of type personnels
    Example:
        SAR Helicopter:
        IR Sensors:
            -#5228 - Generic Infrared Reconnaissance Camera         05nm Max Range
            -#5770 - Generic IR Camera                              15nm Max Range

Disable "SAR_enable" for Survivors

Create a global table that will hold the various "dbid or specific class" that are meant to  depict survivors
    Name: CMOT_Aircraft_SurvivorTypes

Create a repeatable Event "CMOT_SAR_Aircraft SARSurvivorIsFound"
    Trigger:
        [Run Existing Script: UnitIsDetected SARSurvivor_MobilePersonnel]
        Note:
            More categories of this type of trigger for various types of units meant to depict survivors (Survivor types can be found from CMOT_Aircraft_SurvivorTypes)
            -Make the "Hard-to-Identify" units easier to identify by just needing to know the domain/type of contact
