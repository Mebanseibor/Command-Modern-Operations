      - Reference Points
      - Sides
      - Zones
    - #### [游리游끵勇뀬xperimental][directorylink-luascripts-experimental]
      - Civilian traffic between Zone's RP
      - Escort Aircraft
    - #### [游릭Deployed Scripts][directorylink-luascripts-deployedscripts]

## <p id='content-futureadditions'>Future Additions游댩</p>
- ### Scenarios
  - Neckbreaker
    - A scenario between India and China over the disputed region in the NE-Region of India, also including India's [chicken neck][weblink-wiki-siliguricorridor]

- ### Scripts
  - #### Add predefined zones
    - Add zones defined by latitude and longitude
  
  - #### Add Restriction Zones for Civilian Traffic
    - Players can create no-nav zones that restricts civilian aircrafts from travelling within that area
  
  - #### Attack with no change to Side Posture
    - Disallow the automatic change of posture when a manual attack is ordered on a non-hostile contact
  
  - #### Auto-Replenish Ammunition
    - Units replenish their depleted ammo automatically from a supply group
  
  - #### Better reactions for Defensive Aircraft
    - Throttle: AfterBurner
    - Course: Perpendicular
    - Altitude: Dip
  
  - #### Damaged/Destroyed naval units creates oil spill
    - Damanged/destroyed naval units will create oil spills
  
  - #### Dynamic Biologics
    - Random Path
      - Dynamic Speed
      - Dynamic Depth
      - Dynamic Formation
      - Units Seperation
      - Group formations
    - ##### Future Enhancements:
      - Biologics flees away from explosions and sounds
  
  - #### Dynamic Weather
    - Weather Reports on escalated Weather
    - Cyclones with Custom weather Zone
    - AI Units reacting to the weather and Dangerous weather
    - Severe weather affects units:
      - Aircrafts landing or taking off from a base/aircraft carrier under severe weather will induce damage/unability to perform task
      - Naval Vessels takes damage in severe weather
  
  - #### False Contacts
    - False contacts due to outdated equipment
  
  - #### Fully repair units
    - Repair all selected units
    - Repair all units of a side
  
  - #### Fully replenish munitions
    - Units with some/all ammo depleted will have their munitions filled fully
  
  - #### Generate Course with Pattern
    - Generate courses with a selected pattern for a Unit
  
  - #### Generate Life Rafts on destroyed naval assets
    - Generate Life Rafts on destroyed naval 
  
  - #### Generate RandomTime Trigger
    - Ability for events/special actions to generate a randomtime trigger with inputted parameters
  
  - #### Munition Wave Attacks
    - Allocate units to attack other units in a wave with the use of ammunition

  - #### Plot Contact's Predicted Path by Distance
    - Plot a contact's predicted path by a given Distance by using RP Points
  
  - #### Plot Contact's Predicted Path by Time
    - Plot a contact's predicted path by a given Time by using RP Points
  
  - #### Prolonged flight-time induces more maintainance-time
    - Airframes that are subjected to longer than normal flight-time has a higher chance of being requiring longer maintenance
  
  - #### PvP Turn Base Feature
    - Making turn-based PvP games more easier to conduct
  
  - #### Random Spawn Location for Mission Units (using Zone's RP)
    - Units assigned to a particular mission will start at a random point of a zone's points
  
  - #### Random Spawn Location for Mission Units (using Zone)
    - Units assigned to a particular mission will start at a random point within a zone

  - #### Reactive SAMs
    - SAM Sites are smarter at reacting to threats
  
  - #### Realistic Drones
    - Drones requires ground control stations to be controlled

  - #### Set Contact posture to Unknown
    - Reset the posture of a contact back to unknown

  - #### Smarter Prioritized Targetting
    - Units on patrol missions attacks the missile(s)/aircraft(s) that is closer to their target or the mission's protectee
  
  - #### Trail Contact
    - Ability for aircrafts/naval-vessels to trail contacts at a distance

  - #### Use GeoINT to Get Precise Location of Facility
    - Utilise GeoINT to precisely locate a facility that has a small unknown-location box
